      <h3>WELCOME TO YYLAND</h3>
      <p>
         Hi,everyone. I'm Yuanyuan Zhao, visual designer,and this is my story. I was born in China in 1993, I've been learning drawing since I was a little girl, I had a dream of becoming a painter that time, in order to finish my mandatory nine-years' education, I stopped painting and drowned myself in the education system. But in order to continue studying art, I chose adverting as my major in college. After spending four years in the east of China, I continued my study and explored a new territory of art, which is design. So I want to continue my career in design area, and at the same time, I wanted to see the world and broaden my horizon so I could become a better designer, so I applied for some MFA degrees in United States, and I got an offer from Boston University, then I started my life as a graduate student that majored in graphic design in Boston University. To be continued...
      </p>
      <h3>My inspiration</h3>
      <p>
         I love nature, creatures, I love raining days, I love the sound of the thunder. I love the sun, but I love the dark night more. For me , beauty is just around the corner. And they happens in unexpected things.
